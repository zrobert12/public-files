Here is the list of shorter, stronger, and kind responses:

1. "I’ve supported you, and it hurts when my perspective isn’t respected."
2. "I value our friendship, but I also need mutual respect."
3. "Dismissive comments like that make me feel unheard."
4. "I’m here for you, but I need you to hear me too."
5. "I’ve been patient and supportive, and I deserve the same in return."

These statements are concise and maintain kindness while setting boundaries.
